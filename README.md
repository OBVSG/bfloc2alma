# Load BIBFRAME from Library of Congress into Alma

This is a tutorial for the Alma LOD Community of Practice. It's goal is to provide you with a starting point for writing your own scripts. 

The main file is `bfloc2alma.org`, the text for the tutorial as well as all code are written in this file and are exported/tangled into `.html` and `.py` files.

The Tutorial can be found at <https://obvsg.github.io/bfloc2alma/>

## Disclaimer
This is intended to serve as a starting point for your own scripts. There is no error handling or other things you might expect from production software. While I don't expect it to break Alma, I have to emphasize that you use this code at your own risk if you run it against a production system.

This is NOT production software to be used as is.
